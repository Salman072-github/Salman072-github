ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Syed Salman Bacha.

I'm a passionate data analyst with a keen focus on deriving insights from data to understand businesses' and clients' needs. With a strong foundation in English Linguistics, I bring a unique blend of language proficiency and analytical skills to the table. 

Proficient in Python, SQL, and Microsoft PowerBI, I adeptly utilize tools such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and Excel to derive insights and solve complex problems. Moreover, through various online courses, I have developed a solid foundation in data science, including Python programming, data visualization, statistical analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp and was awarded the prestigious Impact Meter Scholarship for Data Science Bootcamp by AtomCamp.

I find solace in books, enjoy computer programming as a hobby, and engage in sports like football and hiking. Fluent in English, Urdu, and Pashto, I value effective communication as a cornerstone of success. If you're seeking a dynamic team member with a passion for data-driven insights and a commitment to making a positive impact, I would be thrilled to connect.

Let's explore opportunities to collaborate and drive meaningful change together.
